for tips 
Add media files in the same folder (e.g., tip-2025-11.jpg or tip-2025-11.mp4 with a poster JPG).

In the Featured section at the top, replace the image/video + quote + month label.

Move last month’s content into a new <details class="tip-card">…</details> block in the Previous Months section.

Keep the newest previous month’s <details> with open if you want it expanded by default.

    How to post articles

Duplicate a .bubble block and change:

href="#" → link to a full post page if/when you create it.

src="blog-YYYY-mm.jpg" → thumbnail image.

data-tags="regulation leadership" → space-separated topics.

Title, excerpt, and date.


contact
If you use Formspree, replace https://formspree.io/f/your-id with your form endpoint.

services
Replace svc-1.jpg, svc-2.jpg, svc-3.jpg with your images (same folder).

Change the service names inside each <figcaption>.

All cards currently link to contact.html. If you later create dedicated service pages, update the href accordingly.

newsletter-form
🔹 Replace https://formspree.io/f/your-id with your actual Formspree endpoint (you get it for free at https://formspree.io
)
🔹 No backend or account login required — it will email submissions straight to you.

background 
If you want actual background images instead of gradients, just use Sora with these prompts and set them per page:

Page	Prompt (soft abstract background style)
Index	“Minimal abstract gradient background in beige, ivory, and gold light, soft smooth transitions, luxury calm aesthetic.”
Services	“Minimal abstract gradient background in soft duck-blue and ivory tones, subtle paper texture, calming modern feel.”
Blog	“Abstract gradient background in neutral tones with faint golden light reflections, modern wellness editorial style.”
Tips	“Warm matte gradient background in sand and soft blush tones, representing reflection and growth.”
Contact	“Calm gradient background in light gray-blue and cream tones, serene modern wellness palette.”

Then you can add in each page’s CSS section:

body[data-bg="services"] {
  background: url('bg-services.jpg') no-repeat center/cover;
}
